<h1> Golas for SpotifyAlarm </h1>
<p> My goals for this application was to make a simple alarm clock application that was both nice looking and powerful and to learn from doing it. This was my first WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application and I learned a lot from creating SpotifyAlarm! </p>
